## The Baseline CORE Specification

The document describes the minimal set of business and technical prerequisites, functional and non-functional requirements, together with a reference architecture for a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) network that when utilized ensures that two or more systems of record can synchronize their system state over said DLT securely and privately.

## Status

The Baseline DLT specification is currently work in progress.
