## The Baseline CORE Specification

The document describes the minimal set of business and technical prerequisites, functional and non-functional requirements, together with a reference architecture that when implemented ensures that two or more systems of record can synchronize their system state over a public Consensus Controlled State Machine (CCSM) network.

## Status

The Baseline CORE specification is currently work in progress.
