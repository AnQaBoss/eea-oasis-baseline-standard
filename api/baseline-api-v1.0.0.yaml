        Creates a baseline `Prover` using the parameters provided in the request body

        Creating a prover entails compiling the prover from source, performing the appropriate setup or multiparty key ceremony and securely persist resulting artifacts.

        You must provision a `Prover` before it can be used to generate and verify proofs. The foregoing holds true regardless of which provider, proving_scheme, curve and prover identifier you specify (or source, if the raw source code of the `Prover` is provided instead of an identifier).

        A persistent store is implicitly initialized upon the creation of a new prover unless an existing store_id is provided and the referenced store is valid in the context of the prover and authorized scope.

        The parameters required to provision a `Prover` vary slightly across providers and proving schemes. Ensure you are using the `source` or `identifier` parameter properly for the selected `provider` and `proving_scheme`.

        Creates and broadcast a transaction in a chain- and protocol-agnostic manner using the parameters provided in the request body

        This API provides an asynchronous, fault-tolerant mechanism for providing some guarantees about how a well-formed transaction will become eventually-consistent with the underlying target Network. Currently, transactions are guaranteed to be successfully broadcast to the target network or timeout within 5 minutes. If a transaction is unable to be broadcast to the network for any reason (i.e., network reachability, invalid nonce etc.) it is retried every 60 seconds. It is likely these retry and timeout constraints will be made more configurable in a future release.

        In addition to the asynchronous and resilient nature of broadcasting transactions using this API, instrumentation of the full transaction lifecycle is captured for each transaction.

        Unseals a `Vault` and enables additional interaction within the authorized scope. 

        One sealing key is valid for all vaults within a single instance. The SEAL_UNSEAL_VALIDATION_HASH environment variable contains a SHA-256 hash of the 256-bit entropy BIP39 seed phrase used for the seal/unseal key. When a valid sealing key is presented to the vault (i.e. one that has the same SHA-256 hash value as the SEAL_UNSEAL_VALIDATION_HASH environment variable), the seal/unseal key will then be cloaked (i.e., encrypted with a random, ephemeral, in-memory cloaking key) in memory and
        decrypted only when required for operations by the cloaking key.

        An arbitrary keypair capable of storing value on the underlying `Network`; also referred to as a signing identity.

        An `Account` may be setup as custodial or non-custodial, and may be derived from a `Wallet`. If the `Account` is custodial then the platform will sign and broadcast transactions to the specified network on behalf of an authorized `Subject`.

            Address of the `Account`

            Implementations should consider how to support an increase from a 20-byte address to a 32-byte address.

            The following illustrates the schema of a 32-byte address:

              Byte 0: Version byte (8-bit padding; reserved for future)
              Byte 1-2: Reserved (16-bit reserved)
              Byte 3-5: Epoch (0 <= e <= 16777215)
              Byte 6-31: 26 byte hash

    OAuth2:
      description: |-
        In accordance with the OAuth 2.0 specification, when a `Subject` is authorized and the requested `scope` includes `offline_access`, a refresh token is vended and returned on behalf of the caller. This refresh token is long-lived and can be used to authorize short-lived access tokens using the `refresh_token `grant type on subsequent authorization requests. This pattern is useful for machine-to-machine applications; a secure practice is to store the
        long-lived refresh token in a Vault instance (i.e., as a secret), read it into application memory during container initialization and then use it to authorize a short-lived access token. If the container remains running long enough for the access token to expire, the refresh token should once again be used to seamlessly authorize a new access token.
